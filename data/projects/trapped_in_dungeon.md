You fell down a random hole into a very deep dungeon, miraculously surviving the fall.
But now, you are now surrounded by monsters that seem to find you very delicious & enticing,
they want to gobble you up.

Your objective is to now survive the seemingly infinite waves of monster, and find a way out. Luckily the monsters drop random skills and items you can use. Killing the monsters also for whatever reason seem to strengthen your body.

How far will you go before you die?
