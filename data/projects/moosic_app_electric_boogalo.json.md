This is an android music app created using android studio (and other tools) for a school project.


Features include:

- Account system using firebase
- Playlists, Shuffle, etc.
- Playing of local music files

Through this project I learned about the android ecosystem and gained an insight into one of the ways android apps are created and developed.
