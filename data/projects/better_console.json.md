This library provides a GUI console for logging with the following features:

- Log box - See log messages
- Log filters - Filter log messages by level
- Input - Enter in commands and stuff

This library is also non-blocking, thus, it wonâ€™t block the regular code execution flow of the program, allowing for easy integration.
